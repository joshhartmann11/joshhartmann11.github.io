The new Fisher
Finance 2.0 is built as a strict framework for supporting plug and play tools, rapid development, and
sharing your homemade tools! Will I ever finish? maybe, but I'm learning lots along the way!

The goal of Fisher Finance 2.0 is for it to run 24-7 on a low powered computer, such as a raspberry pi,
acting as a local server.  This will allow for the monitoring of information without a burden to everyday
work flow on a personal machine.  The framework will allow for homemade tools to be plugged in and shared with
export/import tool options.  The tools will have access to obj common database of common company and stock information and
GUI controlls and objects.
