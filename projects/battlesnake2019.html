BattleSnake is BC's largest programming competition.  This was my second year competing.  My snake, Battle Jake, was entered
into intermediate and made it to the top 6! And an even bigger accomplishment was getting my brother and girlfriend out and
programming for the first time!

My 2019 Jake was built off my <a href="#2018-03-08">2018 Jake</a>. I made the movement restrictions more robust (Added moving
into a tail as a valid move), a better food finding method, and made Jake stay away from the heads of others. The changes weren't
very exciting but I was busy helping others learn to program :).
