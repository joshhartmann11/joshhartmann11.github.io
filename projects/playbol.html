SEng 321, Requirements Engineering is a unique class at UVic.  The class is structured around two projects.  The first
project, called the "mini-project", was used for preparation for the "real" project where each team was paired with
a local tech company.  The projects were based around gathering the requirements and specification for a feature of
interest from our clients.  For the mini-project, our team contacted Vikes Recreation on campus and they were quick
to provide a problem that could be solved with some sort of software system.

The problem given to us was that the data retrieved from the motion detecting air-conditioning system in the squash
courts was unreadable.  Our client would like to use this data to determine trends and update sponsors of activity.
When our team completed the requirements and specification for the system, the client was impressed and wanted the
system to be built.  A few of our teammates decided to take action.  We spent hours developing the user interface before
the back-end data store and graphing features. When it came time to write the data store we realized that we did not have
access to the data we thought we had. There was 2 weeks of air-conditioning state data but only 24 hours of motion sensor
data from each of the data retrievals. Because the air-conditioning system was not able to be interfaced with any
external system, and the lack of data we had to work with, the project fell through.

In reflection, I learned a lot from this experience.  At school, it's easy immediately start working on assignments and
projects because it's assumed that there is a solution and that you'll have all the tools needed to get you there.  In
reality, often times no easy solution exists and contraints must be checked and analysed before starting any work.
