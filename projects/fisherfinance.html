After working at Environment and Climate Change Canada, I was inspired to take my knowledge elsewhere.  After talking
with my brother, a finance major, we outlined a few areas of his work that could easily be automated, and so we decided
to work towards some solutions.  That solution is Fisher Finance.  The application is to be broken into modules and
the first iteration of the first module is complete!

This module, "Statistical Modeling", models opening, closing, high, and low stock price data for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly time series'.
The data is modeled for several distributions and the best fitted distribution is represented in the graph along with
a histogram of the data and the most recent data point. I'm using <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co">Alpha Vantage</a>
and getting my data from http get queries. For the modeling, I couldn't find a decent python module so I'm using the
<a href="http://www.gamlss.com">GAMLSS</a> package in R, which I have previously worked with on co-op.
<br>
Continuing, the next modules that I'll be working on are the following: non-stationary models of the stock data with
indices as covariates; a web scraper to notify the user of unusual activity involving keywords defined by the user;
and a module to produce excel company valuation documents (automating my brothers method).
