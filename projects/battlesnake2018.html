Battle Snake is BC's largest programming competition.  This year was my first and it was a success!  My snake
was named Battlejake, or Jake for short, created within 24 hours of the competition.  The competition is a
twist on the classic snake game.  The goal is to be the last snake alive.

Because of my time constraint, Jake was a completely "if-else" snake.  The snake was built by first outlining movement restrictions,
things like: not hitting walls, not hitting other snakes, not getting eaten by bigger snakes.
<br><br>
After restrictions were determined, a variety of "preferred choice" functions determined the preferred movement of
the snake given the restrictions. These functions were placed in the following order of importance:  Moves that will allow
me to live in the next iteration; food if my health was below a threshold; killing other snakes if I was able to do so;
staying one block away form the walls; and finally, continue to go straight.
<br><br>
Having a preference to always go straight and staying away from walls minimized the chance that I would get
trapped around my own snake.  This characteristic made my snake unique amongst the tail chasing snakes, and allowed
me to excel in un-clustered game boards.

I signed up for the intermediate division and, in the competition, I made it past the first round but lost in
the semi-finals. I had so much fun and I can't wait till BattleSnake 2019 where I hope to spend some time on battlejake2.0.
