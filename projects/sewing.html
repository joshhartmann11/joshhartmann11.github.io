A while back, my mom got a new sewing machine and I decided to take her old one to school.  I've been sparsely using it
for about a year, mostly for fixing pants, but also for making a few things, here are some of my projects.

The computer case on the left was the first item I made on the machine, and was an abrupt introduction to zippers.
The case on the right is for my girlfriend's new laptop.  Both are made from old pants, t-shirts, and zippers
salvaged from an old bag.<br><br>

Someone told me that I couldn't make a quilt, so I did.
It made for a great christmas present and so did the pencil cases!
