I've wanted a 3D printer for a long time I could just justify it. One weekend, I found myself tearing apart old cd drives to build a 3-axis plotter.

I wrote minimal firmware and a little python API for it <a href="https://github.com/joshhartmann11/simple_xyz"><b>here!</b></a>

I figured that the enjoyment I got from this weekend project more than justified buying real components to make a real 3D printer. So I did!

The printer is a custom "H-Bot" configuration running a custom build of Marlin. The power supply is an old modded computer power supply. I made all of the non-standard parts out of
wood because, well, I didn't have a 3D printer to print them. I'm in the process of replacing all the wooden parts with 3D printed ones; taking my time to brush up on my FreeCAD skills.
