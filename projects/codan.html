<a href="https://codancomms.com/products/cascade"><b>Cascade</b></a> is base station repeater and a new product of Codan's. The repeater implements a low current,
high power, reliable digital and analog LMR repeater using the P25 standard. The purpose of a repeater
is to receive and possibly re-transmit an incoming radio signals in the VHF and UHF frequency bands
given configuration options outlined by the P25 standard.  As they are often remote and
used in critical applications, the Cascade productâ€™s goal is to provide reliability and
remote configurability to the end user.  Codan's LMR department produces the entirety of the product from
hardware to software allowing for innovation, quality control, and an internal deep understanding
of the system.  This all helps to provide the best quality of service and products to customers.

My work on Cascade consisted of updating and adding functinality to Linux kernel modules, writing firmware
and algorithms for decoding and encoding DCS, writing firmware and updating code to support reverse burst,
developing hardware/firmware tests for the support of simulcast,
scripting the manual process for building the Linux platform, writing scripts and configuring the platform
for supporting upgrades, factory resets, and software rollbacks.
