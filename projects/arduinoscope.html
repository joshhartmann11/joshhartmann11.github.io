As an electronics hobbyist, Arduinos litter my desk ready to quickly add a touch of software
to my DIY electronics projects.  For one such project I found myself wanting an oscilloscope
to monitor a low frequency UART bus for activity.  I did a quick datasheet lookup for my ATmega32u4-based
board and found out that I could pretty easily get a throughput of 200ksps to my computer, pleanty for this
application and many other too.  I created a quick and dirty Python app using Qt and implemented standard
triggering functions and a waveform generator for testing.  I am currently working on a more formal wxWidgets
C++ version to touch up on my C++ and improve performace of the scope.
