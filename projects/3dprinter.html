First axis complete! The motor, belt, shafts and electromagnet came from an old salvaged Cannon printer.
This axis runs at a maximum speed of ~140 steps/second for a speed of ~70mm/second before the steps become consistently skipped. The stepper motor
is a 5 wire design, 4 coils with one common.  The motor is wired up with +12 volts at the common
and some transistors which ground each coil.

The first runs of the axis revealed a few problems with the mechanical design.  The bending of the belt around
the carriage is the first. I initially thought this wouldn't be a problem but as the carriage gets closer to
the side with the motor, there is less contact with the motor's gear and sometimes causes slipping. Another shortcoming with the drive belt is the friction
on the carriage. To solve both these problems, I'm going to make the carriage slimmer so that there's no sliding
of the belt on it.  This will increase the contact area with the motor and I'll be able to increase the tension
on the belt.<br>
Next steps are to find parts for and build the second axis, get the breadboard circuit onto something more pernament,
and start writing the firmware for gcode decoding and communications with the arduino.
