<h2>
<b>Hydrological Modeling:</b><k style="float:right;">Fall 2017</k><br>
<i>Environment and Climate Change Canada</i><br>
Worked on research in statistical hydrology developing streamflow models of the Athabasca river basin. Used the data
and statistics from these models to create graph and compare new old old methods of nonstationary flood frequency 
analysis. Compiled
results into a poster for display at AGU 2017. In addition to the modeling, I worked with large data sets greater 
than 3 terabytes, writing efficient and multithreaded scripts to process the data to develop metrics for climate 
change. Programmed in R, Matlab, Python, VBA and used GIS software and Excel as graphical tools.
