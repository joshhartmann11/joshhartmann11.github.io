                        <b>Programming and Software Engineering:</b>
                        I enjoy solving everyday problems and challenging myself in software engineering through personal research
                        and software design. I have written a variety of small programs to help with productivity, expand my knowledge,
                        and explore new areas of computer science. Currently, I'm working on <a href="projects.html">a financial application for my brother</a>
                        to automate some tasks for evaluating investments.
                        <br><br>

                        <b>Electronics:</b>
                        As a book-taught electronics hobbyist, I've amassed a collection of electronic components that I
                        enjoy tinkering and building with.  Experienced with soldering small components, integrating
                        software into electonic projects, debugging and building simple circuits. Currently, I'm working on <a href="projects.html">a 3D Printer.</a>
                        <br><br>

                        <b>Woodworking:</b>
                        I enjoy working with my hands and, through many years in a garage workshop, have built everything
                        from pens and wooden locks, to a coffee table and a greenhouse. I grew up helping my Father build
                        our cabin learning about building codes, constraints, and project management.
