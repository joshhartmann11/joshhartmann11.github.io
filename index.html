                        <b>Programming and Software Engineering:</b>
                        Most of my programming is done outside of the context of school. I enjoy solving everyday problems and challenging myself
                        by learning new concepts.

                        building with. Experienced with soldering small components, integrating firmware into electonics projects, debugging,
                        reading, and building simple circuits.
