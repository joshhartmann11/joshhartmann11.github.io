First axis complete! The motor, belt, shafts and electromagnet came from an old salvaged Cannon printer.
This axis runs at a maximum speed of ~140 steps/second for a speed of ~70mm/second before the steps become consistently skipped. The stepper motor
is a 5 wire design, 4 coils with one common.  The motor is wired up with +12 volts at the common
and some transistors which ground each coil. Surprisingly, the transistors handle the 170mA load well enough, 
which works out nicely because MOSFETs are in short supply. I've created a schematic of the circuit using Eagle 
and then next step is to try out some DIY etching, more on that coming soon!<br><br>

The first runs of the axis revealed a few problems with the mechanical design.  The angle that the belt makes with 
the carriage is the first. I initially thought this wouldn't be a problem but as the angle increases on the motor side
there is less contact with the gear which causes slipping. Another shortcoming with the drive belt is the friction 
on the carriage. To solve both these problems, I'm going to make the carriage slimmer so that there's no sliding 
of the belt on it.  This will increase the contact area with the motor and I'll be able to increase the tension
on the belt.
