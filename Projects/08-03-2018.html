Battle Snake is BC's largest programming competition.  This year was my first and it was a success!  My snake 
was named Battlejake, or Jake for short, and he was created within 24 hours of the competition.  The game is a 
twist on the classic snake game.  The goal is to be the last snake alive.  Random games can be found

Because of my time constraint, Jake was a completely "if-else" snake.  The snake was built by first outlining movement restrictions, 
things like: not hitting walls, not hitting other snakes, not getting eaten by bigger snakes. 
<br>
After restrictions were determined, a variety of "preferred choice" functions determined the preferred movement of 
the snake given the restrictions. These functions were placed in the order of importance of:  Moves that will allow 
me to live in the next iteration; food if my health was below a threshold; killing other snakes if I was able to do so; 
staying one block away form the walls; and finally continue to go straight.
<br>
Having a preference to always go straight and staying away from walls minimized the chance that I would get 
trapped in my own snake because I did not look into the future.  This characteristic made my snake unique amongst the 
tail chasing snakes, and allowed me to excel in un-clustered game boards.

I signed up for the intermediate division and in the competition I made it past the first round but lost in 
the semi-finals. I had so much fun and I can't wait till BattleSnake 2019.
