A while back my mom got a new sewing machine and I decided to take the old one to school.  I've been sparsely using it
for about a year mostly for fixing pants but also for making a few things, here are some of my projects<br><br>

The computer case on the left was the first item I made on the machine and was an abrupt introduction to zippers.
The case on the right is for my girlfriends new laptop.  Both are made from old pants, t-shirts, and zippers
salvaged from an old bag.<br><br>

Someone told me that I couldn't make a quilt, so I spend >200h proving them wrong.  
Also made for a great christmas present! <br><br>

Pencil cases make great christmas presents.
