The Water-Climate Impacts Research Center (W-CIRC), is a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada
involved in the research of climate change effects on Canadian water resources. My work was involved
in the Canada-Albeta Joint Oil Sands monitoring program.  At W-CIRC, I was first tasked with performing
non-stationary flood frequency analysis on predicted streamflow data. I modeled flood magnitudes
using GAMLSS a package in R.  The models were then compared to outdated methods of non-stationary analysis. 
The results from this comparison were used to create a poster for display at the AGU 2017 fall meeting. <br><br>

The second part of my co-op term was processing a large dataset produced by a VIC model.  The dataset was
>3 terabytes and provided a great deal of new challenges for me.  One of the challenges arose from the 
sheer size of the set. 
Single threaded scripts would have taken >5 days, so that was eliminated as an option, I needed to run 6 
independant analyses. I ended up
dividing the data set, running the processed in parallel, then combining it later.  Each of my 6 analyses ended up taking around 15 hours each 
which enforced the importance of patience, building robust code, and testing.  Other challenges arose from
corrupted data, microsoft automatic updates, memory-disk access tradeoffs, cpu utilization, and many other
challenges specific to the nature of the data. <br><br>

Though these two tasks were the focus of my co-op term, most of my time was spent producing statistics and 
visual representations of the data from my analyses. I used R, Matlab, GAMLSS, Excel, and ArcGIS to 
produce over 5000 graphs and maps which visually conveyed my results to my supervisor, and were used as a
double check to make sure I was on the right track.  The figures ranged from de-trended quantile-quantile plots for checking the fit of the 
streamflow models to contour plots of the streamflow magnitude results as a function of it's covariates.<br><br>

Overall the experience I had at W-CIRC was amazing. I am often finding new applications of my newly found knowledge 
in statistics, modeling, and programming. More importantly than all the technical knowledge, I also developed my
time management, communication, organizational, and many more personal skills that will be with me in everything I do.
