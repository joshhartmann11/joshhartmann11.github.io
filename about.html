	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<h2>
	I am a 3rd year software engineering student at the University of Victoria, and if you're reading, probably
	looking for a co-op. I enjoy making things in many mediums, but, ultimately, chose software engineering because 
	I could take the things I learned and apply them in the same day in my work. Besides
	building things, I enjoy backpacking, biking, skateboarding, volleyball, skiing/snowboarding, and friends.
	</h2><br>
	
	<h1>What is this website for?</h1>
	<h2>
	It was suggested to me by my co-op advisor to keep track of the projects I do on co-op as part of a
	profile.  I thought there would be no better way to show my projects than with another project. So that is
	this. As well, I've always wanted to keep track of the progress I make on things I build, so keeping a project
	blog of sorts is the perfect solution. 
	</h2><br>
	
	<h1>Web dev?</h1>
	<h2>
	HTML and CSS were the first "languages" I learned which was a result from
	confusion when my brother told me he made his own website. I became jealous and, of course, wanted to do it better, 
	so I googled how to make a website. I spent hours learning HTML, CSS, and a little JS, only to learn that 
	my brother made his website using <a href="http://www.freewebs.com">www.freewebs.com</a>.  The skills stuck but I 
	have little interest in front-end web development.
