                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            	<h3>
            	I am a 3rd year software engineering student at the University of Victoria, and if you're reading, probably
            	looking for a co-op. I enjoy making things in many mediums, but, ultimately, chose software engineering because
            	I could take the things learned at school and apply them in the same day in my work. Besides
            	building things, I enjoy backpacking, biking, skateboarding, volleyball, skiing/snowboarding, and friends.
                </h3><br>

            	<h1>What is this website for?</h1>
            	<h3>
            	It was suggested to me by my co-op advisor to keep track of the projects I do on co-op as part of a
            	profile.  I thought there would be no better way to show my projects than with another project. So that is
            	this.
