                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            	<h3>
            	I am a 3rd year software engineering student at the University of Victoria, and if you're reading, probably
            	looking for a co-op. I enjoy making things in many mediums, but, ultimately, chose software engineering because
            	I could take the things I learned and apply them in the same day in my work. Besides
            	building things, I enjoy backpacking, biking, skateboarding, volleyball, skiing/snowboarding, and friends.
                </h3><br>

            	<h1>What is this website for?</h1>
            	<h3>
            	It was suggested to me by my co-op advisor to keep track of the projects I do on co-op as part of a
            	profile.  I thought there would be no better way to show my projects than with another project. So that is
            	this. As well, I've always wanted to keep track of the progress I make on things I build, so keeping a project
            	blog of sorts is the perfect solution.
                </h3><br>

            	<h1>Web dev?</h1>
            	<h3>
            	I learned HTML and CSS out of
            	confusion when my brother told me he made his own website. I became jealous and, of course, wanted to do it better,
            	so I googled how to make a website. I spent hours learning HTML, CSS, and a little JS, only to learn that
            	my brother made his website using <a href="http://www.freewebs.com">www.freewebs.com</a>.  The skills stuck but I
            	have little interest in front-end web development.
