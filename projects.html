<h2>

After working at Environment and Climate Change Canada I was inspired to take my knowledge elsewhere.  After talking 
with my brother, a finance major, we outlined a few areas of his work that could easily be automated and so we decided
to work towards some solutions.  That solution is Fisher Finance.  The application is to be broken into modules and 
the first iteration of the first module is complete!

This module, "Statistical Modeling", models opening, closing, high, and low stock price data for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly time series. 
The data is modeled for several distributions and the best fitted distribution is represented in the graph along with 
a histogram of the data and the most recent data point. I'm using <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co">Alpha Vantage</a> 
and getting my data from http get queries. For the modeling, I couldn't find a decent python module so I'm using the 
<a href="http://www.gamlss.com">GAMLSS</a> package in R which I have previously worked with on co-op.
<br><br>
Continuing, the next modules that I'll be working on are the following: non-stationary models of the stock data with 
indices as covariates; a web scraper to notify the user of unusual activity involving keywords defined by the user; 
a module to produce excel company valuation documents (automating my brothers method); and recursive ANN prediction 
(just an excuse to play with my NN work).

The Water-Climate Impacts Research Center (W-CIRC), is a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada
involved in the research of climate change effects on Canadian water resources. My work was involved
in the Canada-Albeta Joint Oil Sands monitoring program.  At W-CIRC, I was first tasked with performing
non-stationary flood frequency analysis on predicted streamflow data. I modeled flood magnitudes
using GAMLSS a package in R.  The models were then compared to outdated methods of non-stationary analysis. 
The results from this comparison were used to create a poster for display at the AGU 2017 fall meeting. <br><br>

The second part of my co-op term was processing a large dataset produced by a VIC model.  The dataset was
>3 terabytes and provided a great deal of new challenges for me.  One of the challenges arose from the 
sheer size of the set. 
Single threaded scripts would have taken >5 days, so that was eliminated as an option for I needed to run 6 
independant analyses. I used multithreaded processes 
dividing the data set then combining it later as needed.  Each of my 6 analyses ended up taking around 15 hours each 
which taught me a great deal about patience, building robust code, and testing.  Other challenges arose from
corrupted data, microsoft automatic updates (haha), memory-disk access tradeoffs, cpu utilization, and many other
challenges specific to the nature of the data. <br><br>

Though these two tasks were the focus of my co-op term, most of my time was spent producing statistics and 
visual representations of the data we were getting from the analyses. I used R, Matlab, GAMLSS, Excel, and ArcGIS to 
produce over 5000 graphs and maps which visually conveyed my results to my supervisor and were used as a
double check.  The figures were backed by a multitude of statistics from the data that were 
produced using excel and R and ranged from De-trended Quantile-Quantile plots for checking the fit of the 
streamflow models to contour plots of the streamflow magnitude results as a function of it's covariates.<br><br>

Overall the experience I had at W-CIRC was amazing. I am often finding new applications of my newly found knowledge 
in statistics, modeling, and programming. More importantly than all the technical knowledge, I also developed my
time management, communication, organizational, and many more personal skills that will be with me in everything I do.

First axis complete! The motor, belt, shafts and electromagnet came from an old salvaged Cannon printer.
This axis runs at a maximum speed of ~140 steps/second for a speed of ~70mm/second before the steps become consistently skipped. The stepper motor
is a 5 wire design, 4 coils with one common.  The motor is wired up with +12 volts at the common
and some transistors which ground each coil. Surprisingly, the transistors handle the 170mA load well enough, 
which works out nicely because MOSFETs are in short supply. I've created a schematic of the circuit using Eagle 
and then next step is to try out some DIY etching, more on that coming soon!<br><br>

The first runs of the axis revealed a few problems with the mechanical design.  The angle that the belt makes with 
the carriage is the first. I initially thought this wouldn't be a problem but as the angle increases on the motor side
there is less contact with the gear which causes slipping. Another shortcoming with the drive belt is the friction 
on the carriage. To solve both these problems, I'm going to make the carriage slimmer so that there's no sliding 
of the belt on it.  This will increase the contact area with the motor and I'll be able to increase the tension
on the belt.
