SEng 321, Requirements Engineering is a unique class at UVic.  The class is structured around two projects.  The first 
project, called the "mini-project", was used for preparation for the "real" project where each team was paired with 
a local tech company.  The projects were based around gathering the requirements and specification for a feature of 
interest from our clients.  For the mini-project, our team contacted Vikes Recreation on campus and they were quick 
to provide a problem that could be solved with some sort of software system.
<br><br>
The problem given to us was that the data retrieved from the motion detecting air-conditioning system in the squash 
courts was unreadable.  Our client would like to use this data to determine trends and update sponsors of activity. 
When our team completed the requirements and specification for the system, the client was impressed and wanted the 
system to be built.  A few of our teammates decided to take action.  We spent hours developing the user interface before 
the back-end data store and graphing features. When it came time to write the data store we realized that we did not have 
access to the data we thought we had. There was 2 weeks of air-conditioning state data but only 24 hours of motion sensor 
data from each of the data retrievals. Because the air-conditioning system was not able to be interfaced with any 
external system, and the lack of data we had to work with, the project fell through.

<br>
In reflection, I learned a lot from this experience.  At school, it's easy immediately start working on assignments and 
projects because it's assumed that there is a solution and that you'll have all the tools needed to get you there.  In 
reality, often times no easy solution exists and contraints must be checked and analysed before starting any work.

Battle Snake is BC's largest programming competition.  This year was my first and it was a success!  My snake 
was named Battlejake, or Jake for short, and created within 24 hours of the competition.  The competition is a 
twist on the classic snake game.  The goal is to be the last snake alive.
<br>
<br>
<img src="Projects Supplements/08-03-2018/Snakes.png" style="width:50%;display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;"/>
<br>
<br>
Because of my time constraint, Jake was a completely "if-else" snake.  The snake was built by first outlining movement restrictions, 
things like: not hitting walls, not hitting other snakes, not getting eaten by bigger snakes. 
<br><br>
After restrictions were determined, a variety of "preferred choice" functions determined the preferred movement of 
the snake given the restrictions. These functions were placed in the following order of importance:  Moves that will allow 
me to live in the next iteration; food if my health was below a threshold; killing other snakes if I was able to do so; 
staying one block away form the walls; and finally, continue to go straight.
<br><br>
Having a preference to always go straight and staying away from walls minimized the chance that I would get 
trapped around my own snake.  This characteristic made my snake unique amongst the tail chasing snakes, and allowed 
me to excel in un-clustered game boards.
<br><br>
I signed up for the intermediate division and, in the competition, I made it past the first round but lost in 
the semi-finals. I had so much fun and I can't wait till BattleSnake 2019.

<h2>

After working at Environment and Climate Change Canada, I was inspired to take my knowledge elsewhere.  After talking 
with my brother, a finance major, we outlined a few areas of his work that could easily be automated, and so we decided
to work towards some solutions.  That solution is Fisher Finance.  The application is to be broken into modules and 
the first iteration of the first module is complete!
<br><br>
<img src="Projects Supplements/16-02-2018/FinanceModule1.png" style="width:40%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
<br><br>
This module, "Statistical Modeling", models opening, closing, high, and low stock price data for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly time series'. 
The data is modeled for several distributions and the best fitted distribution is represented in the graph along with 
a histogram of the data and the most recent data point. I'm using <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co">Alpha Vantage</a> 
and getting my data from http get queries. For the modeling, I couldn't find a decent python module so I'm using the 
<a href="http://www.gamlss.com">GAMLSS</a> package in R, which I have previously worked with on co-op.
<br><br>
Continuing, the next modules that I'll be working on are the following: non-stationary models of the stock data with 
indices as covariates; a web scraper to notify the user of unusual activity involving keywords defined by the user; 
a module to produce excel company valuation documents (automating my brothers method); and recursive ANN prediction 
(just an excuse to play with my NN work).

A while back, my mom got a new sewing machine and I decided to take her old one to school.  I've been sparsely using it
for about a year, mostly for fixing pants, but also for making a few things, here are some of my projects.

<br><br>

<img src="Projects Supplements/12-02-2018/quilt.jpg" style="display:block;width:100%;"/>

<br><br>

The computer case on the left was the first item I made on the machine, and was an abrupt introduction to zippers.
The case on the right is for my girlfriend's new laptop.  Both are made from old pants, t-shirts, and zippers
salvaged from an old bag.<br><br>

Someone told me that I couldn't make a quilt, so I spend >200h proving them wrong.  
It made for a great christmas present and so did the pencil cases!

The Water-Climate Impacts Research Center (W-CIRC), is a branch of Environment and Climate Change Canada
involved in the research of climate change effects on Canadian water resources. My work was involved
in the Canada-Albeta Joint Oil Sands monitoring program.  At W-CIRC, I was first tasked with performing
non-stationary flood frequency analysis on predicted streamflow data. I modeled flood magnitudes
using GAMLSS a package in R.  The models were then compared to outdated methods of non-stationary analysis. 
The results from this comparison were used to create a poster for display at the AGU 2017 fall meeting. <br><br>

The second part of my co-op term was processing a large dataset produced by a VIC model.  The dataset was
>3 terabytes and provided a great deal of new challenges for me.  One of the challenges arose from the 
sheer size of the set. 
Single threaded scripts would have taken >5 days, so that was eliminated as an option, I needed to run 6 
independant analyses. I ended up
dividing the data set, running the processes in parallel, then combining it later.  Each of my 6 analyses ended up taking around 15 hours each 
which enforced the importance of patience, building robust code, and testing.  Other challenges arose from
corrupted data, microsoft automatic updates, memory-disk access tradeoffs, cpu utilization, and many other
challenges specific to the nature of the data. <br><br>

Though these two tasks were the focus of my co-op term, most of my time was spent producing statistics and 
visual representations of the data from my analyses. I used R, Matlab, GAMLSS, Excel, and ArcGIS to 
produce over 5000 graphs and maps which visually conveyed my results to my supervisor, and were used as a
double check to make sure I was on the right track.  The figures ranged from de-trended quantile-quantile plots, for checking the fit of the 
streamflow models, to contour plots of the streamflow magnitudes as a function of it's covariates.<br><br>

Overall the experience I had at W-CIRC was amazing. I am often finding new applications of my newly found knowledge 
in statistics, modeling, and programming. More importantly than all the technical knowledge, I also developed my
time management, communication, organizational, and many more personal skills that will be with me in everything I do.<br><br>
Update: Some of the results from the second part of my co-op have been published 
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581817301817">here!</a>

First axis complete! The motor, belt, shafts and electromagnet came from an old salvaged Cannon printer.
This axis runs at a maximum speed of ~140 steps/second for a speed of ~70mm/second before the steps become consistently skipped. The stepper motor
is a 5 wire design, 4 coils with one common.  The motor is wired up with +12 volts at the common
and some transistors which ground each coil. Surprisingly, the transistors handle the 170mA load well enough, 
which works out nicely because MOSFETs are in short supply. I've created a schematic of the circuit using Eagle 
and then next step is to try out some DIY etching, more on that coming soon!<br><br>

<img src="Projects Supplements/15-10-2017/X-Axis Circuit Board.png" style="width:45%;float:right;"/><br><br>
The first runs of the axis revealed a few problems with the mechanical design.  The angle that the belt makes with 
the carriage is the first. I initially thought this wouldn't be a problem but as the angle increases on the motor side
there is less contact with the gear which causes slipping. Another shortcoming with the drive belt is the friction 
on the carriage. To solve both these problems, I'm going to make the carriage slimmer so that there's no sliding 
of the belt on it.  This will increase the contact area with the motor and I'll be able to increase the tension
on the belt.
